## EEG
EEG is the measure of the electrical activity inside the human brain. It measures the voltage changes that are caused due to the ionic movement within the neurons of the brain. The electrical charge of the brain is maintained by billions of neurons that are electrically charged by membrane transport proteins that pump ions across their membranes. There is constant exchange of ions going on between the neurons and the extracellular milieu. Ions of similar charge repel each other. When ions from many neurons are pushed out at the same time, they tend to push their neighbours who thereby push their neighbours, creating a wave. This process is called volume conduction. When this wave of ions reaches the scalp and comes in contact with the metal of the electrode it pushes or pulls electrons of the metal which causes a voltage difference between any two electrodes. The recording of these voltage changes is what forms the EEG signal. 
The electric potential generated by a single neuron is extremely small and hence cannot be picked up by the electrodes. Therefore, EEG activity is always the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons with similar spatial orientation. An EEG signal is measured in the range of microvolts (μV), making it a very small signal to be observed on any instrument.
Some of the main neurological diagnostic applications of EEG are in case of epilepsy, coma and brain death. However, it is also used for studies of sleep and sleep disorders. This is can be done because of the clear abnormalities observed in the EEG signals during these disorders. It can also be used to diagnose tumours and strokes.  
## Brain lobe
The cerebral cortex is further divided into four sections, the lobes. While there are right and left counterparts for each lobe, there are subtle differences between the hemispheres. Sometimes the right hemisphere is associated with creativity and imagination, while the left hemisphere is associated with logic abilities such as numerical and spatial cognition. However, this association is phasing out as scientific research is coming up with more intricate imaging technologies and analysis techniques, which allow for deeper insights than ever before. Yet, a basic division is still made between 4 lobes:- Frontal, parietal,occipital,temporal lobes-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobes_of_the_brain
## brain wave
Brain is one of the most intricate, complex and fascinating elements of the universe. It allows you to remember past events, process all of the present sensory impressions, and project all of your thoughts, memories and estimations into the future. No matter whether you’re asleep or awake, prepare the next business meeting or take a leisure stroll around town, as you think, dream, see and sense, your brain is constantly active. At the root of all our thoughts, emotions and behaviours is the communication between neurons within our brains. Brainwaves are produced by synchronized electrical pulses from masses of neurons communicating with each other.

## the 10/20 sysytem
The list of the most common systems used for defining and naming electrode locations/positions along the scalp have been provided by the American Encephalographic Society (1994) as well as Oostenveld & Praamstra (2001), one of which is the 10-20 System.
The 10-20 System of Electrode Placement is a method used to describe the location of scalp electrodes which are used to record the electroencephalogram (EEG) using a machine called an electroencephalograph.
This system is based on the relationship between the location of an electrode and the underlying area of cerebral cortex. Each point on this figure to the left indicates a possible electrode position. Each site has a letter (to identify the lobe) and a number or another letter to identify the hemisphere location. The letters F, T, C, P, and O stand for Frontal, Temporal, Central, Parietal and Occipital. (Note that there is no "central lobe", but this is just used for identification purposes.) Even numbers (2,4,6,8) refer to the right hemisphere and odd numbers (1,3,5,7) refer to the left hemisphere. The z refers to an electrode placed on the midline. Also note that the smaller the number, the closer the position is to the midline.

## artefact removal
There are many artefacts because of eye movemnet, muscular movement etc. These are to be removed and thus use dimentionality reduction techniques like independent component analysis and principal component analysis.

## deep learning analysis
Tensor Flow model is used to analyse the eeg signal and predict the future values. Windowing method was used to divide in small window of contents and then used convolution to stride through the window. Lstm layers and fully conected layers were used for training and testing of the model. The overall time and space complexity was reduced to a great extent as earlier the models required 64 gb ram and now the model used only 8 gb of Ram.
