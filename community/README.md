# TensorFlow Community Models

We provide a curated list of the GitHub repositories with machine learning models and implementations powered by TensorFlow 2.

Unlike our "[official](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official)" and "[research](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research)" repositories, we do not maintain the GitHub repositories listed here. Their respective maintainers support them.

## Models / Implementations

| Use case | GitHub Repository | Paper | Description | Maintainer(s) |
|----------|-------------------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Computer Vision | [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow2/Segmentation/MaskRCNN) | Mask R-CNN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) | A script and recipe to train the Mask R-CNN model | [NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA) |
| Computer Vision | [U-Net Medical Image Segmentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow2/Segmentation/UNet_Medical) | U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) | A script and recipe to train U-Net Medical | [NVIDIA](https://github.com/NVIDIA) |
