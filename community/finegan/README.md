* FineGAN: Unsupervised Hierarchical Disentanglement for Fine-Grained Object Generation and Discovery 

## Description

FineGAN, a novel unsupervised GAN framework, which disentangles the background, object shape, and object appearance to hierarchically generate images of fine-grained object categories. To disentangle the factors without supervision, the key idea is to use information theory to associate each factor to a latent code, and to condition the relationships between the codes in a specific way to induce the desired hierarchy. Through extensive experiments, FineGAN achieves the desired disentanglement to generate realistic and diverse images belonging to fine-grained classes of birds, dogs, and cars. FineGAN's automatically learned features can also cluster real images as a first attempt at solving the novel problem of unsupervised fine-grained object category discovery.

### Image Generation
 
| Model name | Download | FID | Inception Score |  
|------------|----------|----------------|----------------|  
| Model name | [Checkpoint (300 epochs)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sE52YsxEftFgLrzlpgucQKMw2LCd4IZd?usp=sharing)| 35.76 [11.25] | 14.7 [52.53]|  
  

## Dataset
  
CUB 200 - Fine grained image dataset with 200 classes of birds.
  
## Training

First download the dataset by running the following command:
```shell
python3 data_download.py
```
Please run this command line for training the model from scratch for 100 epochs.

```shell
python3 train.py
```

## Evaluation

>  
> * [TODO]   Benchmark the model and used saved_model to run inferences

<!-- Please run this command line for evaluation.

```shell
python3 ...
``` -->
