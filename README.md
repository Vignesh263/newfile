# TensorFlow Models

This repository contains a number of different models implemented in [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org):

The [official models](official) are collections of models that use TensorFlow's high-level APIs. Models are well-maintained, tested, and kept up to date with the latest stable TensorFlow API. Models should also be optimized for speed and easy to read. We recommend newe TensorFlow users to start here.

Researchers implemented large collection of [research models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research) in TensorFlow. The models are not supported or available in release branches. It is up to the individual researchers to maintain or support the issues from the models and also to accept the pull requests.

The [samples folder](samples) contains code snippets and smaller models that demonstrate features of TensorFlow, including code presented in various blog posts.

The [tutorials folder](tutorials) is a collection of models described in the [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).
